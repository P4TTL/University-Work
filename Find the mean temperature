# Problem: find the mean temperature of the week

# Input: a list of 7 numbers
temperatures = [5, 0, -3, 7, 8, 5, 0]

# Sub-problem: compute the sum of a list of numbers
total = 0
for temperature in temperatures:
    total = total + temperature

# Sub-problem: compute the length of a list
length = 0
for temperature in temperatures:
    length = length + 1

# Output: mean, a number
mean = total / length

print('The mean of', temperatures, 'is', round(mean))
